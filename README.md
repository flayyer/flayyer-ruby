# flayyer-ruby

This gem is agnostic to any Ruby framework and has zero external dependencies.

To create a FLAYYER template please refer to: [flayyer.com](https://flayyer.com?ref=flayyer-ruby)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flayyer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install flayyer

## Usage

After installing the gem you can format URL as:

```ruby
require 'flayyer'

flayyer = Flayyer::FlayyerURL.create do |f|
  f.tenant = 'tenant'
  f.deck = 'deck'
  f.template = 'template'
  f.variables = {
      title: 'Hello world!'
  }
end

# Use this image in your <head/> tags
url = flayyer.href
# > https://flayyer.host/v2/tenant/deck/template.jpeg?__v=1596906866&title=Hello+world%21
```

Variables can be complex arrays and hashes. 

```ruby
flayyer = Flayyer::FlayyerURL.create do |f|
  # ...
  f.variables = {
      items: [
          { text: 'Oranges', count: 12 },
          { text: 'Apples', count: 14 },
      ],
  }
end
```

**IMPORTANT: variables must be serializable.**

To decode the URL for debugging purposes:

```ruby
print(CGI.unescape(url))
# > https://flayyer.host/v2/tenant/deck/template.jpeg?title=Hello+world!&__v=123
```

## Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails will try to safely render strings into the HTML. Any FLAYYER string is already safe-serialized and should not be serialized again.

To prevent double serialization make sure to call `.html_safe` like this:

```ruby
url = flayyer.href.html_safe
```
